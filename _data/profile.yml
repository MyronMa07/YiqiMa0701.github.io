  ## About Me
  Hi, I’m Yiqi 👋  
  I have an academic journey that moves across mathematics, statistics, and ecology, and I enjoy using data to understand how nature and health are connected.  
  I studied Applied Mathematics in Xi’an and Liverpool, trained in Statistics at Warwick, and I’m now pursuing an MSc in *Ecology, Climate Change and Health* at UCL. Along the way I’ve worked on projects such as modelling biodiversity responses to extreme heat, exploring climate–health interactions, and building small tools for data analysis.  
  I’m especially interested in how numbers can tell stories—about bird populations, ecosystems, or human health—and how those insights can help us make better decisions for both people and the planet.  
  Outside research, I love skiing ⛷️, photography 📷, and creating music 🎶.
