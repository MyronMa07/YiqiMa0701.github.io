I successfully completed my MSc dissertation at University College London, titled:  
**“Differential recovery of West Nile virus host and non-host bird populations from extreme heat events: Evidence from lagged and trajectory-based analyses in the southern United States (2007–2022)”**.  

The project, supervised by [Rory Gibb](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/people/academic-staff/rory-gibb), combined large-scale Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data with ERA5 climate reanalysis to investigate how extreme heat affects avian host recovery dynamics.  
This thesis marks the culmination of my MSc in *Ecology, Climate Change and Health*.
